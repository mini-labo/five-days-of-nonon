Here is recorded the deeds of brave souls who challenged FIVE DAYS OF NONON

confirm here the winners chosen by NIST

> The people who deny God cannot understand this
>
> Tables of random numbers have probably been used for multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution. 
> The first published table appears to be by the English statistician L.H.C. Tippett. In the digital age, algorithmic random number generators have largely replaced these tables. 
> The NIST Randomness Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple scenarios in which the latter methods cannot be used. 
> The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features. First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted before they are published. 
> Second, the public, time-bound, and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user application to prove to anybody that it used truly random numbers not known before a certain point in time. 
> Third, this proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future. 
> For example, the proof could be mailed to a trusted third party, encrypted and signed by an application, only to be opened if needed and authorized.
